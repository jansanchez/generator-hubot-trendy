# <%= botName %>

<%= botName %> is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot].

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality is
available, etc!

### Running <%= botName %> Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the environment variables they rely
upon have been set.

You can start <%= botName %> locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    <%= botName %>>

Then you can interact with <%= botName %> by typing `<%= botName %> help`.

    <%= botName %>> <%= botName %> help
    <%= botName %> animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    <%= botName %> help - Displays all of the help commands that <%= botName %> knows about.
    ...

Or you too can start with:

```
HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=HERE_YOUR_TOKEN ./bin/hubot --adapter slack
```

In Slack type `@<%= botName %> hello` and boal√°!
