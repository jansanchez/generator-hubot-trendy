// Description:
//   Example scripts for you to examine and try out.

// Notes:
//   They are commented out by default, because most of them are pretty silly and
//   wouldn't be useful and amusing enough for day to day huboting.
//   Uncomment the ones you want to try and experiment with.

//   These are from the scripting documentation: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md
